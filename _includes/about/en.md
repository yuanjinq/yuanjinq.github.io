Hi, I am Yuan Jinqiang. Currently, I'm engaged in the medical device industry, the CTO of Creative Medtech Solutions Pte. Ltd. in Singapore. I got my Ph.D degree in robotics from the National University of Singapore.

I like programming, taking photos, and playing games.

My greatest achievement, so far, is being able to marry my wife in 2019, and hosted a dream wedding.
